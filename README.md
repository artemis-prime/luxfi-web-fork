# Starter site based on shadcn/next-template

- React using shadcn's ui system (Next 13.4+, Tailwind)
- Restructured and cleaned up slightly
- Pulls all content from static json (`/src/content`)

From shadcn/next-template
A Next.js 13 template for building apps with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

```
bash
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/shadcn/next-template
```

..them improved for use as a Hanzo boilerplate

## Features
